There is a large setup violation of -90.964 ns between image1/score2_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and image1/place_score2_reg[31]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#282 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -91.100 ns between image1/score2_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and image1/place_score2_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -91.117 ns between image1/score2_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and image1/place_score2_reg[17]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
